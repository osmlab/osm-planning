# osm-planning

This repository is for general planning of OpenStreetMap technology - what works, what could be better, and where we're headed.  Think of it like a shared wish list.

We aim to make this a safe place to brainstorm and discuss future goals. We want to hear your ideas on how we can improve the technologies that make up OpenStreetMap. Please keep discussion positive and constructive, and remember to [be nice to one another](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-planning/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). :speak_no_evil:

Actual issues or bug reports for existing OpenStreetMap software should be opened in their appropriate repositories.

See [awesome-openstreetmap](https://github.com/osmlab/awesome-openstreetmap) for a list of OpenStreetMap projects.
